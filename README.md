this project is going on to show us how basic data transmission works.
the requirements for this project have been chosen to be available all over the world, and you can make it with just a couple of bucks.
this repository will be for just the basic data transmission concept and it will continue to be more simplified.
If you want a more improved version of the program, there will be another repository that will make the program more advanced.
